General Security Best Practices



· Software Integrity: Always download BTNG software only from the official website or the official GitHub repository. Verify checksums and PGP signatures before installation.

· Key & Wallet Management: Use hardware wallets for significant fund storage. Securely back up your seed phrases offline in multiple physical locations. Never share private keys or recovery phrases.

· System Security: Keep your operating system and security software up to date. Be vigilant against phishing attempts and fake websites impersonating our project.

Implementation Checklist & Notes



Before publishing, make sure to customize the template:



Replace All Placeholders:

   · security@btng-official.org ➜ Your dedicated, monitored security email.

   · www.btng-official.org ➜ Your official project website URL.

   · v1.0.0 ➜ Your actual current stable version number.

   · XX+ confirmations ➜ Set a clear, practical confirmation standard for your network.

Choose Your Consensus: In Section 4, specify whether BTNG uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and edit the language accordingly. This is critical for accurately describing network security.

Add Specific Details: If BTNG has unique security features, known past incidents, or specific wallet recommendations, add them to the relevant sections to build trust through transparency.

Publish the File: Save this content as SECURITY.md in the root, .github, or docs folder of your main GitHub repository for it to be recognized.
